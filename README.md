# SARIMA-Model-Project

The project's main goal is to address the necessity for businesses to accurately anticipate their inventory levels. Meeting consumer demand, cutting expenses, and preserving ideal stock levels are all made possible by effective inventory management. Making predictions about future inventory needs using historical data is one of the most important ways to accomplish this.

Accurate forecasting of inventory needs is crucial for businesses to maintain optimal stock levels, minimize costs, and meet customer demand. Time series analysis techniques, such as the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, have proven effective in predicting future inventory requirements based on historical data.
